# BILL_DATE_OCR
We receive a lot of bills and sometimes we forget when we received a particular bill and what bill. The BILL_DATE_OCR does the same by extracting the date from the fill but automated. The full api implementation is yet to come, but with the help of given python notebooks, util files etc it performs the task.
